Mutability:

List:
Lists are mutable, which means we can change their values or content after they are created. You can add, remove, or modify elements in a list.
Tuple:
Tuples are immutable, which means once we create a tuple, we cannot change its contents. You can't add, remove, or modify elements in a tuple.

Syntax:
List: 
Lists are created using square brackets [].
Tuple: 
Tuples are created using parentheses ().

Use Cases:

List: 
Lists are commonly used when you have a collection of items that may need to be modified.
Tuple: 
Tuples are typically used when you have a collection of items that should not change throughout the program's execution.
